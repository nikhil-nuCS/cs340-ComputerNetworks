We coded both algorithms together, starting with the link-state algorithm. Sean then tested the link-state algorithm and Nikhil tested the distance-vector algorithm, both on personal computers. After fixing some debugging and fixes corner scenario with adversarial test cases, we then switched and tested the other person's algorithm on moore to ensure the code still worked.
test2.event file ran under a minute on local machines, but took a bit longer on Moore. Similar behavior was noticed with case_10.event test files as well.
